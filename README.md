# FurMODULARITY
FurMODULARITY is a modular watch slightly inspired by [Zack Freedman](github.com/ZackFreedman)'s [Singularitron](https://github.com/ZackFreedman/Singularitron), it has a STM32 MCU (stm32f103c8), a sound circuit with 2x stereo inputs and 2x stereo outputs, 4x module headers on the motherboard and a custom OS based on my EMultiSys project
